# Python-Task-Manager
This is a task manager program I created using Python. 
Upon running the program, you are presented with a menu screen that allows you to choose between the options of:
printing the task list, 
adding, updating, or deleting a task, 
showing incomplete or completed tasks, 
sorting tasks by priority or due date, 
and saving or loading tasks from a CSV file.
