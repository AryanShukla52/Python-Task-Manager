# Python-Task-Manager

This is a task manager program I created using Python. Upon running the program, you are presented with a menu screen that allows you to choose between the options of:  
>-Printing the Task list   
>-Adding, Updating, or Deleting a task  
>-Showing Incomplete or Completed tasks  
>-Sorting tasks by Priority or Due Date  
>-Saving or Loading tasks from a CSV file
>-Quitting the Program
  
  
## Example of the Task Manager Menu
    
  
This is what the Task Manager Menu looks like when you run the program.

## Printing Tasks
  
  
Here I have chosen to print my task list by selecting P or p, which will look like this:

## Adding Tasks
  
  
Now, I have decided to add a task for running a marathon. I first select A or a, then I follow the instructions for adding a task in the valid format.

After my task has successfully been added, I can print my task list again to see it at the bottom.

## Updating Tasks

  
Now suppose a few months have passed and I finished my marathon. Well, I can select U or u and update my task to reflect that it has been completed

And once my task has been updated, I can once again print the list to see my update.
