# Python-Task-Manager

This is a task manager program I created using Python. Upon running the program, you are presented with a menu screen that allows you to choose between the options of:  
>-Printing the Task list   
>-Adding, Updating, or Deleting a task  
>-Showing Incomplete or Completed tasks  
>-Sorting tasks by Priority or Due Date  
>-Saving or Loading tasks from a CSV file
>-Quitting the Program
